# Voice Workspace Navigation Demo

Launch the CDE development build with this folder as its workspace and connect the CDE sidebar.

Check fuzzy file navigation:

> Open the cart summary.

CDE opens `src/cart/cart-summary.ts`.

Check workspace symbol navigation:

> Where is `calculateFinalPrice` defined?

CDE opens `src/checkout.ts`, selects `calculateFinalPrice`, and remembers it as the active navigation target.

Check contextual native code intelligence:

> Show me every reference.

The native References peek should include checkout execution, cart summaries, order drafts, and promotion previews. The provider returns all references, including imports and the declaration; it is not filtered to call sites.

Then close the peek or navigate to a usage and say:

> Go back to its definition.

CDE returns to the remembered `calculateFinalPrice` definition.

Other prepared checks:

- “Open checkout.ts.”
- “Open the order draft.”
- “Open `createOrderDraft`.”
- “Show references to `previewDiscount`.”
- “Open the payments ledger.” should fail without changing the editor.

## Editor choreography

Use placement while opening files and symbols:

- “Keep this open and put the order draft on the right.”
- “Open the cart summary on the left.”
- “Open `calculateFinalPrice` beside this.”
- “Open its definition below.”

Control the native editor layout and history:

- “Split this to the right.” or “Split this below.”
- “Focus the editor on the left.”
- “Move this tab to the right.”
- “Move this whole pane to the left.”
- “Close this tab.”, “Close the other tabs.”, or “Close the other panes.”
- “Pin this tab.”
- “Go back.” or “Go forward.”

## True callers and callees

Open `calculateFinalPrice`, then say:

> Show its actual callers.

CDE opens the native incoming-call hierarchy with `checkout`, `buildCartSummary`, `createOrderDraft`, and `previewDiscount`.

Open `createOrderDraft`, then say:

> Show what this function calls.

CDE opens the outgoing-call hierarchy containing `calculateFinalPrice`.

## Grounded code Q&A

Open `calculateFinalPrice`, place the cursor on its return statement, then ask:

> Why can the discount make this negative?

Claude inspects the repository through read-only search tools. CDE speaks a short answer while the sidebar shows the grounded explanation with `src/checkout.ts:line` citations.

Continue with contextual and repository-wide questions:

- “What does this function do?”
- “Where does `discountPercent` come from?”
- “Which user-visible flows depend on this calculation?”
- “Walk me through the data flow from the cart summary to the final total.”
- “What is risky about changing this function?”
- “How would you fix this at the API boundary?”

The Q&A worker can read, glob, and grep the open workspace. It cannot edit files, run shell commands, browse the web, or use external MCP tools.

## Voice-driven code generation

For an explicit implementation request, CDE uses a separate Claude worker that can inspect and edit the current workspace. It receives the same active-editor, selection, and visible-file context as code Q&A, then opens and highlights the primary changed file using the native navigation bridge.

Set `cde.anthropicApiKey` in CDE's user `settings.json` (or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before launching CDE). The JSON setting is machine-scoped, matching `cde.openaiApiKey`; avoid committing either key to a workspace settings file.

Open `calculateFinalPrice`, place the cursor on its return statement, then say:

> Clamp the discount percentage between zero and one hundred before calculating the total.

Other examples:

- “Add tests for a one-hundred-percent discount.”
- “Refactor this calculation into a named helper.”
- “Add a guard so the total cannot become negative.”
- “Create a checkout validation function and use it here.”

CDE semantically routes every turn before acting. The routing model first selects one final outcome—workspace change, repository question, navigation, editor control, or ordinary conversation—then the execution response receives only that outcome's tool group. This is model-led intent selection, not keyword matching: a mentioned function is context for a change, question, or navigation request according to what the user wants to accomplish. The edit worker is restricted to read, glob, grep, edit, and write tools: it cannot run shell commands, browse the web, use MCP, or access files outside the workspace.

## Golden navigation sequence

1. “Open checkout.”
2. “Keep it on the left and open the order draft on the right.”
3. “Focus the editor on the left.”
4. “Open `calculateFinalPrice`.”
5. “Show its actual callers.”
6. “Focus the editor on the right.”
7. “Close this pane.”
